## ABSTRACT

Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the task of **agentic system failure attribution** . Current state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose **`AgenTracer`** , the first automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated dataset **`TracerTraj`** . Leveraging this resource, we develop **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` , a lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning, capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions. On Who&When benchmark, **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` outperforms giant proprietary LLMs like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up 18 _._ 18%, setting a new standard in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` delivers actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS with 4 _._ 8 _∼_ 14 _._ 2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving agentic AI.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents have exhibited exceptional proficiency across a wide array of cognitive faculties, encompassing perception (Driess et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2024), planning (Zhu et al., 2024; Erdogan et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2024), reasoning (Putta et al., 2024; Masterman et al., 2024), and action (Li et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024). As endeavors to address increasingly intricate challenges, such as iterative tool calling, complex document analysis, and multi-step web navigation, continue to surge, the inherent limitations of relying on a single monolithic model have become increasingly conspicuous.

Consequently, numerous multi-agent frameworks, motivated by collective intelligence (Wang et al., 2025a; Zhang et al., 2024a;b) and the society of mind theory (Minsky, 1988; Li et al., 2023), have emerged, ensembling multiple LLM agents to achieve refined subtask orchestration (Zhang et al., 2025d; Hu et al., 2025), ultra-long context handling (Zhang et al., 2024d), and broader environmental perception (Jiang et al., 2024). These systems have demonstrated superior performance over single-agent counterparts across a range of complex real-world domains, including data science engineering (Hong et al., 2024), scientific discovery (Ghareeb et al., 2025; Ghafarollahi & Buehler, 2024), and software engineering (Wei et al., 2025). However, the integration of multiple autonomous agents alongside diverse auxiliary modules ( _e.g._ , external databases, tools, and memory modules) inevitably exacerbates **system fragility** . As evidence, a recent empirical study by UC Berkeley (Cemri et al., 2025) reveals alarmingly high failure rates (reaching up to 86 _._ 7%) in popular multi-agent frameworks such as OpenHands (Wang et al., 2025b) and MetaGPT (Hong et al., 2023), with failure modes ranging from improper task decomposition to role disobedience. Such a high incidence of failure casts a long shadow over the real-world reliability of multi-agent systems.

A natural response to this challenge is **failure attribution** , _i.e._ , the precise identification of faulty components within the system upon task failure. Accurate failure attribution plays a critical role across multiple dimensions: **(I) system debugging** , by enabling agentic systems to perform more effective self-debugging across iterative attempts, thereby enhancing performance; **(II) data efficiency** , by leveraging failed agent trajectories to construct more informative training data; **(III) grounded self-improvement** , by facilitating grounded self-correction through precise agent credit assignment. Despite its importance, this process is predominantly left as a manual endeavor, requiring considerable human effort to analyze verbose trajectory logs.

While preliminary attempts have been made toward automation, their efficacy remains limited. For instance, Zhang et al. (2025c) employed state-of-the-art models such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeekR1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024) to perform failure attribution over trajectories from GAIA (Mialon et al., 2023), yet achieved accuracy below 10%. More critically, existing benchmarks for agentic failure attribution remain notably constrained. To the best of our knowledge, MAST (Cemri et al., 2025) and Who&When (Zhang et al., 2025c) contain only 200 and 127 manually annotated multiagent failure trajectories, respectively, offering limited scale for systematic evaluation. Accordingly, substantial research gaps remain along two critical axes: ❶ **training resources** , concerning the automated construction of large-scale annotated multi-agent trajectories; and ❷ **methodology** , on developing swift and accurate multi-agent failure localizer, which we also refer to as a _tracer_ .

**Present Framework.** To address the aforementioned research gap, we present **(1)** **`AgenTracer`** , a fully automated pipeline for constructing well-annotated multi-agent failure trajectories, and **(2)** **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` , a lightweight failure attributor for multi-agent systems. Methodologically, **`AgenTracer`** leverages ♣ **counterfactual replay** , systematically replacing agent actions with oracle guidance to identify the decisive error step responsible for system failure. To enhance data diversity and ensure annotation precision, it further adopts ♠ **programmatic fault injection** , synthetically generating failure instances by perturbing successful trajectories through targeted corruption. Further, we fine-tune QWEN3-8B on the curated dataset to obtain **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` via reinforcement learning (RL), enabling it to analyze long-horizon multi-agent collaboration traces. **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` takes as input the trajectory log and associated environmental feedback, and outputs the identified decisive error step. A **multi-granular reward** is designed to supervise RL training, emphasizing both _step-level_ and _agent-level_ attribution accuracy. During inference, **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` enables any malfunctioning agentic system to rapidly identify the critical failure step along with explanations, thereby facilitating automated multi-agent debugging.

Our contributions are as follows:

- ❶ **Automated Pipeline.** We propose **`AgenTracer`** , the first automated pipeline for annotating multi-agent system failures, curating over 2,000 high-fidelity failure trajectories across six datasets through counterfactual replay and programmatic fault injection.

- ❷ **Failure Tracer.** We develop **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` , a lightweight failure tracer dedicated for LLM agentic systems, trained via a multi-granular reinforcement learning to ensure accurate attribution at both the step and agent levels, facilitating automatic agentic system debugging.

- ❸ **Empirical Evaluation.** Experiments show that **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` facilitates **_(I) accurate attribution_** , outperforming giant LLMs like DEEPSEEK-R1 by _∼_ 12 _._ 21% and GEMINI-2.5-PRO

by _∼_ 18 _._ 18% on Who&When benchmark; and **_(II) self-evolution_** , enabling off-the-shelf agentic systems to improve performance by 4 _._ 8 _∼_ 14 _._ 2%.

## 2 RELATED WORKS

**LLM-based Multi-Agent System.** Contemporary multi-agent systems can be broadly categorized by their level of automation into three classes: ■ **Handcrafted** , where the entire system configuration ( _e.g._ , LLM backbone, prompting strategies, and communication protocols) is manually specified represented by AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023), AutoGPT (Richards & et al., 2023), Camel (Li et al., 2023), and ChatDev (Qian et al., 2023); ■ **Partially Automated** , which automate specific system components: for example, AutoAgent (Chen et al., 2023a), LLMSelector (Chen et al., 2025), and MasRouter (Yue et al., 2025) automate agent role assignment; DsPy (Khattab et al., 2023) and TextGrad (Yuksekgonul et al., 2024) optimize prompt design; GPTSwarm (Zhuge et al., 2024) and G-Designer (Zhang et al., 2024b) adaptively construct inter-agent topologies; ■ **Fully Automated** , where all modules within the system are autonomously designed and evolved (Hu et al., 2024a; Zhang et al., 2024c; 2025b; Wu et al., 2025; Nie et al., 2025; Gao et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025a). Our method is designed to provide precise error tracing across this entire spectrum of agentic systems. Accordingly, we curate trajectories sampled from frameworks spanning all three categories.

**Failure Attribution for Agents.** As multi-agent systems become increasingly intricate, incorporating multiple intelligent agents Wang et al. (2023); Chen et al. (2023b), tool integrations Shen et al. (2024), and communication protocols Marro et al. (2024), the resulting high error rates and structural fragility have emerged as critical concerns. MAST (Cemri et al., 2025) was the first to alarmingly characterize this issue, identifying fourteen prevalent failure patterns ranging from task disobedience to reasoning-action mismatches. Building upon this, Who&When (Zhang et al., 2025c) explored the feasibility of automating failure attribution, only to reveal that even top-performing reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 fail catastrophically in this setting. **`AgenTracer`** advances the field by introducing both a scalable data synthesis pipeline and a lightweight, high-accuracy failure attributor.

**LLM-as-a-Judge & Credit Assignment.** Two other research topics closely related to this work are: **(I) LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ)** , which leverages LLMs/agents as evaluators based on pre-defined criteria for tasks such as data annotation (Latif et al., 2025; OpenAI, 2022), value alignment (Ji et al., 2025), reward modeling (Mahan et al., 2024; Lambert et al., 2024), and synthetic data generation (Sengupta et al., 2025; Hu et al., 2025). However, when applied to multi-LLM systems, LaaJ has shown limited effectiveness, as demonstrated in Zhang et al. (2025c); **(II) Credit Assignment** is a longstanding topic in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), aiming to associate individual agent actions with their long-term outcomes (Pignatelli et al., 2023). Common approaches include heuristics based on temporal contiguity (Sutton, 1988), value decomposition (Arjona-Medina et al., 2019), and meta-learning (Yin et al., 2023). However, this problem remains largely unexplored in the context of LLM-based multi-agent systems. The most relevant prior effort, CollabUIAgents (He et al., 2025), relies on LLMs to generate binary scalar (0 _/_ 1) rewards after each agent interaction, whose reliability is inherently questionable. In contrast, **`AgenTracer`** implicitly achieves grounded credit assignment for LLM agents through principled failure attribution.

## 3 PRELIMINARY

In this section, we provide a general definition of LLM-based multi-agent systems and their operational workflow, and then formally define the objective of the multi-agent failure attribution.

**Notations** Consider a LLM-based multi-agent system _M_ , tasked with collaboratively resolving a user-issued query _Q_ . The system consists of _N_ agents, indexed by _I_ = _{_ 1 _,_ 2 _, . . . , N }_ , operating in discrete time under a turn-based protocol, _i.e._ , only one agent is active at each time step. Formally:

_M_ = � _I, S, A,_ Ψ _, µ_ � _,_ (1)

where _S_ denotes the set of system states; _A_ is the overall action space, with each agent _i ∈I_ having a local space _Ai ⊆A_ ; _µ_ ( _t_ ) _∈I_ specifies the agent scheduled to act at time _t_ ; Ψ( _st_ +1 _| st, at, µ_ ( _t_ )) models the state transition dynamics given the current state _st_ , action _at ∈Aµ_ ( _t_ ), and the acting agent. At each step _t_ , the active agent _µ_ ( _t_ ) selects an action _at ∈Aµ_ ( _t_ ) according to its policy _πµ_ ( _t_ ), conditioned on the current state _st_ , the query _Q_ , and a subset of the prior interaction history _Ht_ :

Figure 2: The overview of our proposed **`AgenTracer`** .

The structure of _Ht_ is implementation-dependent. In LLM Debate-style frameworks (Du et al., 2023), it comprises the prior-round outputs from all agents; whereas in software development systems (Qian et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2024b), a tester agent may condition only on the latest code snippet submitted by a programmer agent. The full execution trajectory of the system is denoted by:

where _T_ indicates the terminal step or stopping condition. The final response to the query _Q_ is determined by the complete trajectory _τ_ , encapsulating the collaborative behavior of all agents.

**Objective Formulation** A trajectory may contain multiple suboptimal actions or minor deviations, but for effective, targeted debugging, it is crucial to distinguish these from the pivotal error that renders the final outcome incorrect. Following (Zhang et al., 2025c), we formalize this pivotal error as the **decisive error** , _i.e._ , the earliest action in the trajectory whose correction is sufficient to steer the system from failure to success. Formally, let Ω( _τ_ ) _∈{_ 0 _,_ 1 _}_ be a binary evaluation function indicating failure (Ω( _τ_ ) = 0) or success (Ω( _τ_ ) = 1), and _R_ ( _τ, t, a_<sup>_′_</sup> _t_<sup>) be an oracle rectification oper-</sup> ator, which represents an idealized process where the original action _at_ is replaced by a theoretically perfect, oracle-provided action _a_<sup>_′_</sup> _t_<sup>, and all subsequent steps are re-simulated.Naturally, the set of all</sup> decisive agent-step pairs _C_ ( _τ_ ) can be expressed as:

from which we select the root cause by targeting the earliest error in time. The definitive failureresponsible agent _i_<sup>_∗_</sup> and decisive error step _t_<sup>_∗_</sup> are therefore given by:

Consequently, the goal of our failure tracer, **`AgenTracer`** , is to take a failed trajectory _τ_ as input and output the failure-responsible agent _i_<sup>_∗_</sup> and the decisive error step _t_<sup>_∗_</sup> .

## 4 METHODOLOGY

Figure 2 illustrates the pipeline of **`AgenTracer`** and the training process of **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` . Specifically, **`AgenTracer`** aggregates trajectories from six mainstream multi-agent frameworks and six datasets, which then applies programmatic fault injection (for successful trajectories) and counterfactual corrections (for failed ones) to identify the decisive error step, yielding 2,000+ trajectory–error step pairs, collectively referred to as **`TracerTraj`** -2.5K. We then train a dedicated failure attributor, **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` , using RL guided by multi-grained rewards to accurately locate errors.

4.1 **`AgenTracer`** : AUTOMATIC TRAJECTORY ANNOTATION

**Collection.** **`AgenTracer`** begin by considering a collection of _M_ (= 6) distinct multi-agent systems, _{Mm}_<sup>_M_</sup> _m_ =1<sup>,andacorrespondingsetofqueriesforeachsystem,</sup><sup>_Dm_=</sup><sup>_{Q_(</sup> _j_<sup>_m_)</sup> _}_<sup>_n_</sup> _j_ =1<sup>_m_,drawn</sup>

from various task domains. For each query _Q_<sup>(</sup> _j_<sup>_m_)</sup> , _Mm_ executes and generates a raw trajectory _τj_<sup>(</sup><sup>_m_)</sup> . For the specific frameworks and datasets used, please refer to Section 5.1. The trajectories from each system can be split into two sets, namely the successful ( _T_ succ<sup>(</sup><sup>_m_)) and failure (</sup><sup>_T_</sup> fail<sup>(</sup><sup>_m_)) corpus:</sup> _T_ succ<sup>(</sup><sup>_m_)=</sup><sup>_{τ_(</sup> _j_<sup>_m_)</sup> _|_ Ω( _τj_<sup>(</sup><sup>_m_)</sup> ) = 1 _},_ and _T_ fail<sup>(</sup><sup>_m_)</sup> = _{τj_<sup>(</sup><sup>_m_)</sup> _|_ Ω( _τj_<sup>(</sup><sup>_m_)</sup> ) = 0 _}._ (6) The overall successful and failure set can be expressed as _T_ succ =<sup>�</sup><sup>_M_</sup> _m_ =1<sup>_T_</sup> succ<sup>(</sup><sup>_m_)</sup> and _T_ fail = � _Mm_ =1<sup>_T_</sup> fail<sup>(</sup><sup>_m_), respectively, which serve as the raw input for the subsequent annotation stages.</sup>

**Locating Decisive Errors.** To empirically identify the decisive error pair ( _i_<sup>_∗_</sup> _, t_<sup>_∗_</sup> ) for each failed trajectory _τ ∈T_ fail, we now detail our practical implementation of the rectification operator _R_ introduced in Equation (4), which is is orchestrated by an analyzer agent _π_ analyzer to conduct counterfactual intervention. _π_ analyzer is provided with the full context of a failure: the trajectory _τ_ , environmental feedback _F_ ( _e.g._ , code execution errors, tool errors), and the ground-truth solution _G_ for _Q_ . For each step _t_ in the trajectory, the analyzer proposes a minimally invasive, corrected action _a_<sup>_′_</sup> _t_ designed to rectify the local error without revealing the complete solution:

By sequentially applying this analyzer-driven intervention for _t ∈{_ 0 _,_ 1 _, . . . , T }_ and evaluating the outcome Ω( _R_ ( _τ, t, a_<sup>_′_</sup> _t_<sup>)),wecansystematicallysearchfortheearlieststep</sup><sup>_t∗_thatsatisfiesthe</sup> condition in Equation (5). The agent active at this step, _i_<sup>_∗_</sup> = _µ_ ( _t_<sup>_∗_</sup> ), is labeled as the problematic agent, yielding a precise annotation ( _τ, ⟨i_<sup>_∗_</sup> _, t_<sup>_∗_</sup> _⟩_ ) for our dataset. This process (as presented in Lines 1 to 8 of Algorithm 1), applied across the entire _T_ fail, forms _D_<sup>_−_</sup> = _{_ ( _τ, ⟨i_<sup>_∗_</sup> _, t_<sup>_∗_</sup> _⟩_ ) _| τ ∈T_ fail _}_ .

**Utilizing Successful Trajectories.** To further augment our dataset with high-precision annotations, we also leverage the corpus _T_ succ through **programmatic fault injection** . Its core principle is to take a known-good trajectory and programmatically introduce a fault, thereby creating a synthetic failure instance where the decisive error is known by construction. Specifically, for each successful trajectory _τ ∈T_ succ, we select a step _t_ to serve as the injection point, at which a perturbation synthetically-generated trajectoryoperator Π is utilized to the original _τ_ ˜ is created by substituting this corrupted action:action _at_ to generate a corrupted action _a_ ˜ _t_ = Π( _at_ ). A new,

_τ_ ˜ = _R_ ( _τ, t,_ ˜ _at_ ) _._ (8)

definition, the decisive error forIf this injection process successfully _τ_ ˜. This allows us to generate a set of positive-sample datasetsinduces a failure ( _i.e._ , Ω(˜ _τ_ ) = 0), the pair _⟨µ_ ( _t_ ) _, t⟩_ is, _D_<sup>+</sup> by:

_D_<sup>+</sup> = _{_ (˜ _τ, ⟨i_<sup>_∗_</sup> _, t_<sup>_∗_</sup> _⟩_ ) _| τ ∈T_ succ _, τ_ ˜ = _R_ ( _τ, t,_ Π( _at_ )) _,_ Ω(˜ _τ_ ) = 0 _, ⟨i_<sup>_∗_</sup> _, t_<sup>_∗_</sup> _⟩_ = _⟨µ_ ( _t_ ) _, t⟩} ._ (9) The overall process is also elaborated in Lines 8 to 17 of Algorithm 1.

**Curated Dataset.** By uniting the annotations derived from both failed trajectories and synthetically generated ones, we construct our final, comprehensive dataset, denoted as _D_ tracer = _D_<sup>_−_</sup> _∪D_<sup>+</sup> , which we also refer to as **`TracerTraj`** -2.5K, comprising over 2,000 high-fidelity annotated trajectory-error pairs. Detailed statistics on the dataset’s composition are placed in **??** .

4.2 **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` : TRAINING AGENTIC FAILURE TRACERS

Having curated the _D_ tracer dataset, we proceed to train our failure tracer, **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` , whose base model is set as QWEN3-8B. This phase aims to incentivize the model’s ability to accurately pinpoint decisive errors within complex, long-horizon trajectories. Since our approach is orthogonal to the RL algorithm, we conduct the experiments based on a widely used online RL method, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Guo et al., 2025).

**Online Reinforcement Learning.** For each trajectory _τ_ sampled from _D_ tracer, the current policy _π_ old generates a group of _G_ candidate decisive error pairs, _{⟨_<sup>ˆ</sup> _ik, t_<sup>ˆ</sup> _k⟩}_<sup>_G_</sup> _k_ =1<sup>, each of which is evaluated</sup> against the ground-truth annotation _⟨i_<sup>_∗_</sup> _, t_<sup>_∗_</sup> _⟩_ using a multi-granular reward function _Rk_ , which will be detailed below. Unlike the standard GRPO, we omit the KL divergence term and introduce a dynamic clipping parameter _Bs_ , which has been demonstrated to better balance exploration and exploitation throughout training (Liu et al., 2025). The RL objective is thus formulated as:

**Algorithm 1:** Automated Trajectory Annotation Pipeline of **`AgenTracer`**

The dynamic clipping parameter _Bs_ is defined as _Bs_ = max(0 _._ 2 _·B_ 0 _, B_ 0(1 _− S_ total _<u>s</u>_<sup>)), with</sup><sup>_s_as the current training step and</sup> _S_ total the total number of steps. This dynamic schedule intuitively encourages broader exploration in the initial stages of training and gradually shifts to more stable exploitation as the policy converges.

**Multi-Granular Reward Design.** Regarding the implementation of advantage estimation in Equation (10), we introduce a multi-granular reward designed to evaluate both the correctness of the attribution and the structural integrity of the output. The total reward _Rk_ for a candidate prediction _p_ ˆ _k_ is a gated combination of content accuracy and format compliance:

whose components are further defined as follows:

- **Format Reward** Iformat is a strict binary reward that equals 1 if and only if the model’s output adheres to the required structure: reasoning must be enclosed within _⟨_ think _⟩· · · ⟨/_ think _⟩_ tags, followed by a final answer within _⟨_ answer _⟩· · · ⟨/_ answer _⟩_ tags. Furthermore, the answer itself must be formatted as _⟨_ agentID _⟩| ⟨_ stepID _⟩_ for accurate extraction.

- **Agent-Level Reward** _r_ agent is a coarse-grained, binary reward that measures whether the tracer correctly identifies the failure-responsible agent _i_<sup>_∗_</sup> , defined as _r_ agent(<sup>ˆ</sup> _ik_ ) = I(<sup>ˆ</sup> _ik_ = _i_<sup>_∗_</sup> ), where I( _c_ ) is a binary indicator for the accuracy of located problematic agent.

- **Step-Level Reward** _r_ step incentivizes temporal proximity to the true decisive error _t_<sup>_∗_</sup> . We use a Gaussian kernel where the reward decays smoothly as the predicted step _t_<sup>ˆ</sup> _k_ moves away from _t_<sup>_∗_</sup> :

where _σ_ controls how sharply the reward penalizes distance from the correct step.

This multi-granular design creates a smoother reward landscape for failure localization, as the partial credit from _r_ step stabilizes training. Simultaneously, the hard gating from _r_ format ensures the model produces reliably parsable outputs. Through online RL with these designs, we obtain a reasoningbased multi-agent failure attributor **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` .

Each cell reports two values: the left corresponds to the setting _w/ G_ (the failure tracer has access to ground truth trajectory), and the right corresponds to _w/o G_ .

## 5 EXPERIMENTS

### 5.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

**Dataset Curation.** For collecting **`TracerTraj`** -2.5K, we opt for six widely-used multi-agent systems, comprehensively incorporating all automation levels: ■ **manually configured** , including MetaGPT (Hong et al., 2023), AutoGen (Wu et al., 2023) and Smolagents<sup>1</sup> ; ■ **partially automated** , including AgentPrune (Zhang et al., 2024a); ■ **fully automated** , including AFlow (Zhang et al., 2024c) and OWL-Workforce (Hu et al., 2025). Six benchmarks from three domains include ■ **coding** , MBPP+ (Liu et al., 2023), KodCode (Xu et al., 2025) and Blackjack (Hong et al., 2023); ■ **general agentic tasks** , GAIA (Mialon et al., 2023); ■ **mathematical reasoning** , MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021).

**Environment.** All experimental results are obtained on one server with 8 NVIDIA H100 (80 GB) GPUs. For RL training in Section 4.2, we use the verl<sup>2</sup> training platform.

**Model & Parameter Configuration.** The analyzer agent _π_ analyzer in Equation (7) and perturbation operator Π in Equation (9) are both based on DEEPSEEK-R1 (Guo et al., 2025) (see prompts in Appendix B). The coefficient _λ_ in Equation (11) is consistently set as 0 _._ 5, and the parameter _σ_ in Equation (12) equals 1. The LLM backbone used for training **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` is QWEN3-8B. For RL traning in Section 4.2, we set batch size to 32, rollout number 8, and learning rate 1 _×_ 10<sup>_−_6</sup> .

**Benchmarks & Evaluation.** To evaluate the failure attribution capability of **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` , we adopt the Who&When benchmark (Zhang et al., 2025c), which comprises two subsets: a handcrafted set derived from Magnetic-One (Fourney et al., 2024), and an automated set constructed from AG2 (Microsoft, 2024). Both subsets provide unseen trajectories with respect to **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` . In addition, we sample a held-out test split from **`TracerTraj`** -2.5K using a 9:1 ratio, yielding three - evaluation subsets (devided by domains): **`TracerTraj`** -code, **`TracerTraj`** -math, and **`TracerTraj`** agentic. Detailed statistics are reported in Appendix A. For evaluation, following (Zhang et al., 2025c), we adopt two primary metrics: _agent-level accuracy_ and _step-level accuracy_ . The former measures whether the attributor correctly identifies the faulty agent _i_<sup>_~~∗~~_</sup> within a trajectory, while the latter assesses whether the specific erroneous step _t_<sup>_∗_</sup> is localized. We consider two evaluation settings: _(i) w/ G_ , where the attributor has access to the ground truth _G_ during failure attribution, and _(i) w/o G_ without such access. The latter setting is harder and particularly valuable. We follow the “all-at-once” setting introduced in MAST, where the entire trajectory is provided to the LLM in a single pass, as Zhang et al. (2025c) has demonstrated this to be the most stable and effective.

**Baselines.** We compare **`AgenTracer`** agaist LLM baselines of varying scales, encompassing **small-size models** such as QWEN3-8B (Yang et al., 2025) and LLAMA-3.2-3B (Grattafiori et al., 2024); **medium-size models** , including QWEN3-32B and QWEN3-CODER-480B-A35BINSTRUCT (QWEN3-CODER) (Yang et al., 2025); and **large-size models** , which primarily consist of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4.1 (OpenAI, 2025), GEMINI-2.5-PRO (Comanici et al., 2025), CLAUDE-4-SONNET (Anthropic, 2025) and also DEEPSEEK-R1 (Guo et al., 2025).

### 5.2 MAIN RESULTS

This section provides empirical evidence that **_`AgenTracer`_** _`-8B` outperforms substantially larger models in failure attribution within complex agentic systems._ Tables 1 and 2 report results on Who&When and **`TracerTraj`** subsets, respectively, presenting both agent-level and step-level attribution accuracy. Each table entry is divided into _w/ ground truth G_ and _w/o G_ during attribution.

**Observation** ❶ **: prevailing models are inadequate as failure attributors.** As shown in Table 1, smaller models such as QWEN3-8B and LLAMA-3.2-3B fail to deliver meaningful judgments, with step-level accuracy on Who&When (handcrafted) remaining below 10%. Even substantially larger models like DEEPSEEK-R1 and GPT-4.1 perform unsatisfactorily, achieving only 31 _._ 32% and 29 _._ 52% step-level accuracy on Who&When (automated) despite access to ground-truth _G_ . Notably, providing _G_ does not consistently improve attribution accuracy; for example, on **`TracerTraj`** -math, CLAUDE-4-SONNET attains 46 _._ 03% ( _w/ G_ ) versus 50 _._ 79% ( _w/o G_ ), and on Who&When (handcrafted), QWEN3-CODER achieves 51 _._ 72% versus 60 _._ 35%. This suggests that ground-truth supervision may sometimes mislead the attribution process, an observation consistent with prior findings in MAST (Zhang et al., 2025c).

**Observation** ❶ **:** **`AgenTracer` consistently surpasses giant proprietary LLMs such as CLAUDE4-SONNET in both agent- and step-level attribution.** Under the _w/ G_ setting, as shown in Table 1, **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` outperforms GPT-4.1 and CLAUDE-4-SONNET on Who&When (handcrafted) by 26 _._ 0% and 12 _._ 2% in agent-level accuracy, respectively. A similar trend is observed on **`TracerTraj`** (Table 2), where **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` improves step-level accuracy on **`TracerTraj`** -agentic by 22 _._ 68% over its backbone QWEN3-8B, while also surpassing DEEPSEEK-R1 (+9 _._ 04%) and GEMENI-2.5PRO (+17 _._ 57%). More importantly, in the _w/o G_ setting (arguably the more realistic scenario where ground truth is unavailable), **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` remains robust: on **`TracerTraj`** -math, DEEPSEEK-

Figure 4: Case study of failure attribution in a long-chain document analysis task, comparing three models (QWEN3-8B, CLAUDE-4-SONNET, and **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` ).

R1 suffers a 9 _._ 21% drop without _G_ , whereas **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` maintains 57 _._ 63%. This strongly substantiates the real-world deployability and practical significance of **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` .

### 5.3 BOOSTING MAINSTREAM MAS

Having established the accuracy of **`AgenTracer`** in failure attribution, a natural question arises: _what practical value does it provide?_ The most direct answer is its potential to supply actionable feedback to failing LLM-based agentic systems, thereby enabling swift self-improvement. To assess this capability, we compare **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` with two classical self-refinement approaches, Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023) and CRITIC (Gou et al., 2024). Specifically, when an agentic system _M_ completes a problem-solving episode and produces a failed trajectory _τ_ , we supply _τ_ ( _w/o G_ ) to either **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` or Self-Refine/CRITIC. Each method then generates reflective feedback on the failure (for **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` , this corresponds to the reasoning trace extracted from _⟨_ think _⟩· · · ⟨/_ think _⟩_ ). This feedback is subsequently injected into _M_ during the next round of problem solving, with the aim of leveraging external critique to enhance its performance. We iterate this process for three rounds, and both Self-Refine and CRITIC are instantiated using GPT-4.1.

**Observation** ❸ **:** **`AgenTracer-8B` enables performance gains of up to** 14% **for existing agentic systems.** To evaluate whether **`AgenTracer`** can provide beneficial feedback to both _seen_ and _unseen_ agentic systems and datasets, we consider three representative systems, MaAS (Zhang et al., 2025b), OWL Workforce, and MetaGPT, together with GAIA, HumanEval+ (Liu et al., 2023), and MATH-500 benchmarks. As shown in Figure 3, conventional reflection-based approaches fail to deliver meaningful insights for complex agentic trajectories. Even when powered by GPT-4.1, CRITIC consistently degrades performance ( _e.g._ , CRITIC+MaAS+GAIA accuracy drops by _−_ 4 _._ 9% at iteration-2 and _−_ 5 _._ 5% at iteration-3). Conversly, **`AgenTracer`** steadily improves outcomes across all settings. Notably, OWL is the open-source SOTA on GAIA for June 2025, yet **`AgenTracer`** still manages to boost its performance by +4 _._ 8%. On MaAS+MATH-500, the gains are even more striking, reaching +14 _._ 21%, substantially surpassing both Self-Refine and CRITIC. Overall, these results demonstrate that **`AgenTracer`** provides reliable corrective feedback and substantial performance improvements across diverse domains for complex agentic systems.

### 5.4 CASE STUDY

Figure 4 presents a comparative case study where QWEN3-8B, CLAUDE-4-SONNET, and **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` analyze the same failed trajectory. The task requires identifying the region with the highest infant formula sales in a company’s Q1 2024 sales data. The final (incorrect) answer produced was “North.” QWEN3-8B offers only a superficial diagnosis, mistakenly attributing the failure to a code execution error by the Coder Agent at Step 6. CLAUDE-4-SONNET goes beyond this surface-level issue and observes that the error at Step 6 may have deeper causes. In contrast, **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` precisely identifies that the root cause lies in Step 2, where the Web Surfer agent retrieved incorrect file with wrong date, an error that only becomes apparent when analyzing

evidence at Step 11. This highlights the intrinsic difficulty of failure attribution in agentic systems: errors are often subtle, originate early, and remain hidden behind seemingly correct outputs.

## 6 CONCLUSION

This work establishes a principled foundation for the study of agentic system failure attribution. By introducing **`AgenTracer`** , we provide the first automated framework capable of systematically generating annotated failure trajectories, as well as **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` , a lightweight yet effective failure tracer that leverages multi-granular RL to achieve prevailing diagnostic accuracy. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that **`AgenTracer`** `-8B` not only surpasses state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs like GEMENI-2.5-PRO and CLAUDE-4-SONNET on the Who&When benchmark but also yields consistent performance gains when deployed within real-world multi-agent frameworks. Beyond advancing the state of failure attribution, our approach paves the way for self-correcting and self-evolving agentic systems, marking a step toward more resilient and autonomous collective intelligence.

|---|

- IMPORTANT: To save the diagnosis result, you MUST use the Editor.create_file command with the following format:

- First, create the file using Editor.create_file command {{ "command_name": "Editor.create_file", "args": {{ "filename": "{task_id.replace(’/’, ’_’)}_diagnosis.json"

- }}

- }} Then use command to modify the content. Please analyze the task and provide your diagnosis in the specified JSON format. The diagnosis result should be saved to a file named ’{task_id.replace(’/’, ’_’)} _diagnosis.json’ in the workspace directory."""

- Prompt for Analyzer Agent prompt = f"""You are an intelligent attack expert analyzing a successful execution for a programming task.

- Your goal is to identify the most critical step in the execution history that, if modified, would lead to an incorrect final result.

- Task Information: Task ID: {task_id} Question: {success_log[’question’]} Ground Truth: {success_log[’ground_truth’]} Model Prediction: {success_log[’model_prediction’]} {previous_attack_info} Original Task Execution History: {history_str} {history_constraint} Your attack analysis should be in the following JSON format: {{ "attack_step": <step_number>, // The step number where the attack should be applied

- "mistake_agent": "<the agent that made the mistake>", // The agent that made the mistake

- "original_content": "<brief description of what this step does>", // Brief description of the original step

- "attack_content": "<SPECIFIC, IMPLEMENTABLE attack instructions with concrete code changes>", // SPECIFIC attack instructions

- "reason": "<detailed explanation of why this step is critical and how the attack would work>" // Detailed explanation

- }} CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ATTACK_CONTENT: 1. The attack_content MUST be SPECIFIC and IMPLEMENTABLE 2. Include CONCRETE CODE CHANGES or MODIFICATIONS 3. Provide SPECIFIC instructions that can be directly executed 4. Focus on FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES that will cause the program to fail 5. Examples of good attack_content: - "Change the return statement from ’return tup + (dct,)’ to ’return list(tup) + [ dct]’"

- - "Modify the function to return None instead of the tuple" - "Add a bug: change ’return tup + (dct,)’ to ’return tup + (dct, dct)’ (duplicate the dictionary)"

- - "Change the function to ignore the dictionary: ’return tup’"

- 6. AVOID vague instructions like "return incorrect type" or "modify the function" Important Guidelines: 1. Focus on identifying the root cause of potential failure, not just any step. 2. The ’attack_step’ should be a number corresponding to a step in the implementation process.

3. The ’mistake_agent’ should be the agent that made the mistake.

4. The ’original_content’ should briefly describe what the step does.

5. The ’attack_content’ MUST be SPECIFIC and IMPLEMENTABLE with concrete changes. 6. The ’reason’ should be detailed and explain why this step is critical and how the attack would work.

7. Analyze the original task execution history to understand the context and identify where things could go wrong.

8. Focus on steps that involve code generation, implementation, or key algorithmic decisions.
